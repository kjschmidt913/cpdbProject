# Supervisorsâ€™ Influence within the Chicago Police Department
A quarter long project in collaboration with the [Invisible Institute's Citizen's Police Data Project](https://cpdp.co/). Our theme is analyzing the influence supervisors have over those they manage in terms of misconduct.

### Checkpoints and code 
We have 5 checkpoints where we explored different aspects of our theme using data science tools and concepts. You can find the results and analysis of each checkpoint in a `findings.pdf` file. The `README.md` file in every checkpoint contains instructions with how to run our code and descriptions of the files within the repository.
